# Project Topic: Women in Tech and Their Startups

The focus of this project is on women entrepreneurs in the tech industry, particularly the startups they have founded and their social and economic impact.

## Identifying the Gap

Although data about startups and founders is available on platforms like Wikidata or Crunchbase, information about female tech entrepreneurs is often sparse or inconsistently structured. There is also a lack of semantic connections that show how women-led startups contribute to innovation and social change.

This project addresses that gap by creating RDF triples that capture:
- The founder (a woman)
- The startup and its area (e.g. FinTech, EdTech, AI)
- Geographic context (country of origin, operation)
- Social or economic impact (e.g. empowering women, education access)

## Why This Topic?

Women in technology continue to be underrepresented, especially in leadership and entrepreneurial roles. Highlighting their contributions through knowledge graphs helps:
- Enrich public datasets
- Enable advanced querying and reasoning
- Provide structured insights into gender diversity in tech

## What Will Be Modeled?

We will define entities such as:
- Female founders
- Startups
- Countries
- Impact areas

These will be linked using RDF properties and ontologies. The project will also use LLMs to generate new data (ABox) and enrich under-described resources.
