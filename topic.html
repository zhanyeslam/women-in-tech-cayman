<h1>Project Topic: Women in Tech and Their Startups</h1>

<p>
The focus of this project is on women entrepreneurs in the tech industry, particularly the startups they have founded and their social and economic impact.
</p>

<h2>Identifying the Gap</h2>
<p>
Although data about startups and founders is available on platforms like Wikidata or Crunchbase, information about female tech entrepreneurs is often sparse or inconsistently structured.
There is also a lack of semantic connections that show how women-led startups contribute to innovation and social change.
</p>
<p>
This project addresses that gap by creating RDF triples that capture:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The founder (a woman)</li>
  <li>The startup and its area (e.g. FinTech, EdTech, AI)</li>
  <li>Geographic context (country of origin, operation)</li>
  <li>Social or economic impact (e.g. empowering women, education access)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why This Topic?</h2>
<p>
Women in technology continue to be underrepresented, especially in leadership and entrepreneurial roles. Highlighting their contributions through knowledge graphs helps:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enrich public datasets</li>
  <li>Enable advanced querying and reasoning</li>
  <li>Provide structured insights into gender diversity in tech</li>
</ul>

<h2>What Will Be Modeled?</h2>
<p>We will define entities such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Female founders</li>
  <li>Startups</li>
  <li>Countries</li>
  <li>Impact areas</li>
</ul>
<p>
These will be linked using RDF properties and ontologies. The project will also use LLMs to generate new data (ABox) and enrich under-described resources.
