# Women in Tech: Knowledge Graphs and Language Models

This project explores the contributions of women entrepreneurs in the technology sector using Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs).  
We model the relationships between female founders, their startups, geographic origins, and areas of impact.

The project includes:
- RDF triples describing the entities
- SPARQL queries with advanced operators
- Prompts and comparisons across LLMs
- A structured website with code, results, and analysis
